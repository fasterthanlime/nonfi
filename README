Let's summarize:

  - NetworkManager devs have been at it for years, and it still sucks:
     * random disconnects on non-trivial networks (WPA2+radius)
     * takes ages to connect
     * sucky configuration UI in recent versions
     * sometimes it's hard to figure out what it's doing, which network it's connecting to, etc.

  - wicd is supposed to be an alternative, but...
     * the UI really, really sucks
     * for WPA2+radius, you have to *paste* the certificate path by hand! there's no browse dialog..
     * sucky handling of networks with the same ESSID (checkbox, unclear, still display duplicates)
     * unclear strategy for choosing the network to connect to

So here's my try. It's a good showcase for ooc-gtk :)
